# Bayesian Estimation and Comparison of Idiographic Network Models

## Overview

This repository contains code to reproduce the analyses in the paper "Bayesian Estimation and Comparison of Idiographic Network Models" by Siepe, Kloft & Heck (2024). You can find the preprint here: [https://psyarxiv.com/uwfjc/](https://psyarxiv.com/uwfjc/).

A BibTeX entry of the published version for LaTeX users is:

```BibTeX
@article{siepeBayesianEstimationComparison2024,

  journaltitle = {Psychological Methods},
  volume = {Advance Online Publication},

}
``` 

The freely available preprint is available at PsyArXiv.

Start the .Rproj file 'var-compare.Rproj' before running the scripts.

Full simulation results are too large (multiple GBs) and can be requested from the corresponding author. Intermediate simulation results will be provided when possible.

Code to test the implementation of the model in Stan, including code for the simulation study, is available in the repository [`stan-gvar`](https://github.com/bsiepe/stan-gvar). 


## Main Folder

This folder contains the relevant scripts to reproduce the analyses of the initial 1st version of the manuscript:

- All auxiliary functions used in the project are found in `aux_funs.R`.
- Data-generating true networks can be obtained using `true-networks.Rmd`.
- Simulation Study 1 can be reproduced using `simulation-1.Rmd`.
- Simulation Study 2 can be reproduced using `simulation-2.Rmd`.
- The empirical example can be reproduced using `empirical-example.Rmd`.
- Session information is available in `session_info.txt`.


## `data/`
Contains the data-generating processes used in simulation study 1 & 2.

## `figures/`
Contains all figures used in the manuscript and the supplementary materials.

## `output/`
Contains intermediate results for simulation study 1:

- `df_eval_bggm_0705.RDS`: Evaluation of the Bayesian approach for the first simulation study.
- `df_eval_gvar_0705.RDS`: Evaluation of the LASSO approach for the first simulation study.

## `revision1/` 

The scripts for the first revision of the paper are located in this folder:

Attempts to create tests that obtain evidence for the Null can be found under:

- `between-compare-testing.Rmd`
- `revision-posterior-predictive.Rmd`
- `simulation-2-revision-diffpost-both.Rmd`
- `simulation-2-revision-diffpost.Rmd`
- `simulation-2-revision-meanpost.Rmd`

These are not necessary to reproduce the main results of the paper.

The revised simulation study scripts are available at:
- `simulation-1-revision.Rmd`
- `simulation-2-revision.Rmd`

These can be used to reproduce our simulation results.
