# var-compare

## Overview

This repository contains code to reproduce the analyses in the preprint "Bayesian Estimation and Comparison of Idiographic Network Models" by Siepe & Heck (2023).
It is best to start the R project **var-compare.Rproj** to run all the scripts.

Full simulation results are too large (multiple GBs) and can be requested from the corresponding author. We try to provide intermediate simulation results where possible. 

## main folder
This folder contains the relevant main scripts to reproduce the analyses.

All auxiliary functions used in the project can be found in **aux_funs.R**. 
The data-generating true networks can be obtained using **true-networks.Rmd**.
Simulation Study 1 can be reproduced using **simulation-1.Rmd**.
Simulation Study 2 can be reproduced using **simulation-2.Rmd**.
The empirical example can be reproduced using **empirical-example.Rmd**.
Session information can be found in **session_info.txt**.
