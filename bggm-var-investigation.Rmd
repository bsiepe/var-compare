In this file, I investigate some of the properties of BGGM var_estimate. 
Does it actually work well? If so, the following should be true.
1. It should perform regularization as it says.
2. It should recover roughly the same estimate as, e.g., graphicalVAR. 


# Test regularization
```{r}
set.seed(2022)
graph <- randomGVARmodel(Nvar = 6, probKappaEdge = 0.1, probBetaEdge = .5)
dat <- as.data.frame(graphicalVARsim(200, beta = graph$beta, kappa = graph$kappa))
res <- BGGM::var_estimate(dat,
                          beta_sd = 1)
res2 <- BGGM::var_estimate(dat,
                           beta_sd = 0.1)


```

# Compare with GraphicalVAR
The results seem suffciently similar. 
```{r}
res_gvar <- graphicalVAR(data = dat,
                         lambda_beta = 0,
                         lambda_kappa = 0)


```
